# Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weightlifting Exercises using R (Machine Learning)

Environment: R (3.3.1) and R Studio (1.0.136)

We used machine learning and pattern recognition techniques to detect mistakes during weightlifting exercises. since we had a huge datasets, we did feature selection using PCA and Correlation techniques. We applied our training data with/without preprocessing and cross validation on different methods like Random Forest, C5.0 Decision Tree, SVM with linear and radial kernel. We trained our model on the basis of Confusion Matrix and Kappa Coefficient performance metrics.

The Random Forest model with both preprocessing and cross-validation produces a surprisingly accurate model that is sufficient for predictive analytics.
